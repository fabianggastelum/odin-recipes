    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Gorditas are some kind of tortilla, they can be filled with many
         things and can be sweet or salty.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup masa harina</li>
        <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon shortening</li>
        <li>1 cup hot water</li>
        <li>1 cup oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>

    <h3>Preparation:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, stir together the masa harina, salt and hot<br/>
             water. Gradually mix in the shortening and flour. If the dough<br/>
             seems dry, add a little more hot water. Form the dough into<br/>
             balls that will fit into the palm of your hand.</li>
               <br/>
        <li>Line a work surface with waxed paper or plastic. Sprinkle with water.<br/>
             Flatten balls on the wet surface until about 1/4 inch thick.</li>
             <br/>
        <li>Heat a griddle or comal over medium heat. Cook the gorditas on each<br/>
             side until they are cooked through.</li>
             <br/>
        <li>Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over medium to medium-high heat<br/>
             until hot. Fry each gordita until puffed, pressing it down into the<br/>
              oil occasionally with a spatula. Drain briefly on paper towels, cut<br/>
               the tips off and stuff full of your favorite foods.</li>
    </ol>
