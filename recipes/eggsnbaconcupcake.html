    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Potatoes, bacon and eggs unite in this all-in-one delicious breakfast cupcake.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 red potatoes, peeled and grated</li>
        <li>2 bulbs shallots, chopped</li>
        <li>6 slices bacon, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>8 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 roma (plum) tomato, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted and sliced (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <h3>Preparation:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
            Grease a 12 cup muffin pan with cooking spray.</li>
            <br/>
        <li>In a large skillet, fry the bacon pieces over medium heat until browned and crisp,<br/>
             about 8 minutes. Drain off half of the grease. Transfer the bacon and remaining <br/>
             grease to a large bowl. Stir in the shredded potato, shallot and Parmesan cheese.<br/>
              Divide this mixture evenly between the muffin cups. Pour eggs into each cup, <br/>
              filling to the top.</li>
              <br/>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the egg is firm, about 12 minutes. <br/>
            Remove from the oven and set the dial to Broil. Place a slice of tomato <br/>
            onto each cupcake and return to the oven. Broil for about 3 minutes, or <br/>
            until toasted. Allow to cool slightly, then arrange the cupcakes on a <br/>
            tray and top each one with a slice avocado, if using.</li>
    </ol>
